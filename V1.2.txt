Update following the release of FNaF 2 mostly because I've learnt new things

# Five Night at Freddy's 1 Update time !

Even after fnaf2's dev & release, I'd surely not abandon this port !

## V 1.2.0 content :
- Modified Golden Freddy's special scene to make it look better
- Modified power outage scene (adding some little footstep when no lights)
- Fixed a bug about the office having a weird sprite when no lights
- Fixed and cleaned some bugs
- Optimized the hell out of the port, to add more frames for the screamers !

## MORE FRAMES !!
- 1 More for Freddy when lights out
