# FNaF-PS1-Project
I made the port of the legendary video game FNaF 1 into... The PlayStation 1 !

If you want to make a video about it and post it on youtube (for example), I can add your video here ! (if I like it c:)

By using ancient scrolls left by the ancestors (psyq + nugget sdk) I've made my way into playstation 1 programmation, and I developed this game, or this demake.

Because this demake is not something you have to play on PC with a .exe, you'll have to play it with an ps1 emulator, or the actual console !

If you want to play on the real hardware, you'd have to modchip it, or use the disc swap method or FreePSXBoot ! (google it)

The game has unique things that were not on the OG game, such as two player mode, Custom night with far more options, easter eggs, and more !
